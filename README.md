# Linear Regression in Machine Learning using Python and Sklearn

The ["Linear Regression in Machine Learning using Python and Sklearn"](https://datascrutineer.com/linear-regression-ml-python-sklearn/) article's source code

Overview
--------
This project aims to introduce begginers to ML using linear regression and the California Housing Prices Dataset. We will train and evaluate two linear regression models using the scikit-learn library to understand the underlying patterns in the data and predict house prices.

Dataset Description
-------------------
The dataset includes these features:
* MedInc: median income (dollars) in a block group
* HouseAge: median house age in years within a block group
* AveRooms: average number of rooms per household in a block group
* AveBedrms: average number of bedrooms per household in a block group
* Population: total population for the entire block group
* AveOccup: average number of household members within a block group
* Latitude, Longitude: latitudinal and longitudinal coordinate of the block group's centroid

Results
--------
The multiple linear regression model achieved an MAE of 0.53, RMSE of 0.7, and R2 score of 0.59. This indicates that our model is able to predict house prices with a good degree of accuracy for a linear model.
